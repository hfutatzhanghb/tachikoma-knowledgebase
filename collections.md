        ```
        the front-end does two main things - fetch instructions (from where program binaries are stored in memory or the caching system), and decode them into micro-operations. 
        ```

        ```
        The back-end of the pipeline is responsible for executing the micro-operations the front-end generates.

        A specific microarchitecture may make available hundreds of events through its PMU.
        ...
        you can benefit from using predefined events and metrics, and the top-down characterization method to convert the data into actionable information
